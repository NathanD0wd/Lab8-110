The process of graceful degradation is designing a web app to work when all of the technology is available, and then adding in the ability to still function when that technology is disappearing. This relates to service workers because service workers are a way to implement graceful degradation. When you have internet connection, it works fine, and then when you lose the internet connection, the service workers kick in and it still works fine.
